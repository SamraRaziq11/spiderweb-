         <h1 class="my-heading">About Me</h1>
         <p class="lead-para">
            My name is Samra Raziq, a 20-year-old student currently pursuing my academic journey at Jagran Lakecity University. 
            I am a perky, enthusiastic, and driven individual with a deep-rooted passion for coding and programming languages.
            From a young age, I have been fascinated by the logic, structure, and creativity that coding demands, which has inspired me to constantly explore new technologies and refine my technical skills.
            I thrive in challenging environments that allow me to apply analytical thinking and problem-solving to real-world scenarios.
            With a positive mindset and a commitment to continuous learning, I aim to make meaningful contributions in the field of software development and technology.
            My curiosity and creative mindset drive me to approach challenges with optimism and innovation, while my disciplined nature ensures consistent progress and growth.
            As someone who thrives in collaborative environments, I enjoy exchanging ideas, learning from others, and contributing to projects that push the boundaries of what technology can achieve. 
            I am particularly interested in building user-friendly digital solutions that have a positive impact on people's everyday lives. 
            My portfolio reflects not only my technical skills but also my dedication, adaptability, and passion for continuous improvement. 
            With a strong academic foundation and a forward-thinking approach, I aspire to establish myself as a capable and confident developer in the tech industry.
            <br><br>
            Outside of coding, one of my greatest inspirations comes from my lifelong admiration for Spider-Man. I am an extremely devoted and passionate fan,
            some might even say an insanely obsessed one — and I proudly know almost everything there is to know about the Marvel Universe. From the smallest comic book details to the entire timeline of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, 
            I have watched every movie, followed every storyline, and drawn personal inspiration from the resilience, intelligence, and sense of responsibility that define Spider-Man's character.
            His journey teaches me to stay grounded, work hard, and always use my abilities for good. My love for Marvel, and especially Spider-Man, 
            isn't just a hobby — it's a source of motivation that fuels my creative spirit and keeps me striving for excellence in everything I do.
            In many ways, Spider-Man's philosophy — “With great power comes great responsibility” — has become a guiding principle in both my personal and academic life.
            His ability to juggle everyday struggles with heroic duties mirrors my own determination to balance academics, creativity, and self-growth.
            Whether it's through late-night coding sessions or passionately debating Marvel theories with friends, I bring the same energy and excitement into all my pursuits. 
            My interests extend beyond just fandom; they shape how I think, how I problem-solve, and how I connect with the world around me.
            I believe that being passionate and unapologetically myself is what truly sets me apart — and I carry that belief into every line of code I write.
         </p>
         <p>
            In conclusion, coding has been one of the most transformative and empowering aspects of my life. It has not only sharpened my logical thinking and problem-solving abilities but has also given me a creative outlet to express my ideas and build real-world solutions.
            Through every project, challenge, and breakthrough, coding has taught me resilience, patience, and the value of continuous learning. It has helped me discover my true potential and shaped my identity as a confident and ambitious individual. 
            Just like Spider-Man uses his powers to make a difference, I strive to use my coding skills to create meaningful impact — and that, to me, is the greatest power of all.
            Moreover, coding has opened up a world of opportunities, allowing me to connect with like-minded individuals, collaborate on exciting innovations, and stay on the cutting edge of technology
            It has instilled in me a strong sense of discipline, boosted my self-confidence, and made me more curious about how things work behind the scenes in the digital world. Whether I am developing an app, designing a website, or debugging a complex issue,
            I find joy in the process and pride in the results. Coding isn't just a skill for me — it's a mindset, a passion, and a lifelong journey that continues to inspire me every single day.
